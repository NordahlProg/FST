Code for FarmSalmTrack

This repository documents the R-code for the FarmSalmTrack project. FarmSalmTrack is a collaboration between the Norwegian Veterinary Institute and the major salmon farming companies in Norway. The goal of the project is to find the geographical origin of escaped farmed salmon by analyzing the geochemical content in their scales, thereby pin-pointing which farm it has escaped from.
